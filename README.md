So the idea behind this is I studied YouTube algorithm for a year after running a gaming channel (Kolosafo Gaming) and reached 3000 subs in 5 months (Trust me, I am one of the few people to pull this offer from nothing). After deeply studying YouTube and read some books on growing on it, I figured that growing a normal channel on YouTube is not the same as growing a gaming channel because the Audience are different yet the algorithm remains the same. 
To give you an idea of what I mean, It is very essential to get users to watch a good portion of your videos and one of the best ways to achieve that (according to all the books I read on YT growth) is to use 'a hook' and that is eesentialy telling the viewer what they would get out of the video after watching. This enables them to watch longer as it reaffirms what they came looking for, but for gaming channels, we mostly just post gameplays, 90% of us are not like pewdiepie. This means that gaming channels are less likely to use this method to grow. Luckily there are other ways to grow on YouTube which people aren't really taking advantage of, such as YouTube SE, Keyword Optimization, Descriptions and Title Copying (as bad as it might seem, this is very powerful), "Great artists copy". 

This app offers a lot of things beyond what I have stated above, Including THE FUNCTIONALITY TO SHOW YOUR VIDEO, THUMBNAIL AND TITLE, DESCRIPTION IN AMONGST THE TOP VIDEOS SIMILAR TO THE ONE YOU'RE UPLOADING, JUST TO GIVE YOU AND INSIGHT ON HOW YOUR VIDEO MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOP ONES (THIS IS A THING WITH THUMBNAILS), I created this particular feature just because I know a video's thumbnail is it's gate way for gaining views.


APP 75% DONE!
